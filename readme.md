Source code for Gameboy for MIST
================================

This is source code of a gameboy implementation for the MIST. 

It's based on the [t80](http://opencores.org/project,t80) CPU core. A minor
fix was needed for the "LD ($FF00+C)" instruction.

The audio implementation has been taken from the PACE framework. The
original file is available in the [pacedev svn](https://svn.pacedev.net/repos/pace/sw/src/component/sound/gb/gbc_snd.vhd).

Binaries are available at https://github.com/mist-devel/mist-binaries/tree/master/cores/gameboy.
